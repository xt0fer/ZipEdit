# ZipEdit (_Beta_)

Things to add to the Zip Edit text editor....

- currently when you save, the file chooser pops up and asks you to save a picked file.
  - it should, if there is a filename not equal to the empty string, just save to the file name.
  - add this capability
- add an edit menu to do cut/copy & paste
- add a find menu item to the edit menu
- if changes have been made to the editor, do not allow the user to quit without saving the file or discarding the changes.
- add a way to auto-save the edits after a small number of seconds

## Advanced things

Just how good of a java programmer do you think you are?

Can you add:

- multiple tabs to the GUI to be able to edit multiple files?
- add a "dark mode" (why? I dunno, y'all seem to think dark modes are cool.)
- add a terminal pane that comes and goes based on a menu item at the bottom of the JFrame
- be sure to run the user's preferred SHELL in the terminal

## Adding the "java vi" code
